// What Day Is It?

// Write a function that takes a year, month, and day as numbers and returns the name of the weekday for that date.

// Note that the month parameter is 1-indexed (1 for January, 2 for February, ..., 12 for December).

// Examples
// getDayOfWeek(2024, 5, 11); // "Saturday"
// getDayOfWeek(2023, 1, 1);   // "Sunday"
// Example 1
// Input: year = 2024, month = 5, day = 11

// Output: "Saturday"

// Explanation: May 11, 2024 was a Saturday.

// Example 2
// Input: year = 2023, month = 1, day = 1

// Output: "Sunday"

// Explanation: January 1, 2023 was a Sunday.

// Constraints
// year will be an integer between 1900 and 2100.
// month will be an integer between 1 and 12.
// day will be a valid day for the given month and year.

// Topics
// dates
// Date-object
// arrays

// Hints
// Hint 1. JavaScript's Date constructor takes a 0-indexed month (0 for January, 11 for December).
// Hint 2. You can use the `.getDay()` method of a Date object, which returns 0 for Sunday, 1 for Monday, etc.
// Hint 3. Store the names of the weekdays in an array and use the result of `.getDay()` as the index.



function getDayOfWeek(year: number, month: number, day: number): string {
  const date = new Date ( year, month-1, day )

  const weekdays = [
     "Sunday",
    "Monday",
    "Tuesday",
    "Wednesday",
    "Thursday",
    "Friday",
    "Saturday",
  ]

  return weekdays[date.getDay()]!
}

console.log(getDayOfWeek(2024, 5, 11));
