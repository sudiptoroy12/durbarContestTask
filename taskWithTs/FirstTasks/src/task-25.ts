// Rainfall Peaks

// Given an array of daily rainfall measurements, find all the "peak" days.

// A day is considered a peak if its rainfall is strictly higher than both its immediate left (previous day) and right (next day) neighbors.

// Because the first and last days do not have both neighbors, they can never be peaks.

// Return an array of the 1-based day numbers (i.e., the first day is day 1, the second is day 2, etc.) that are peaks, in chronological order.

// Examples
// findRainfallPeaks([2, 5, 3, 3, 7, 4, 4, 6]) should return [2, 5] because:

// Day 2 (value 5) is strictly greater than Day 1 (2) and Day 3 (3).
// Day 5 (value 7) is strictly greater than Day 4 (3) and Day 6 (4).
// Day 8 (value 6) only has a left neighbor, so it cannot be a peak.
// findRainfallPeaks([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) should return [3] because Day 3 (value 3) is strictly greater than Day 2 (2) and Day 4 (2).

// Example 1
// Input: rainfall = [2,5,3,3,7,4,4,6]

// Output: [2,5]

// Example 2
// Input: rainfall = [1,2,3,2,1]

// Output: [3]

// Constraints
// rainfall will be an array of numbers representing daily rainfall.
// The length of rainfall will be between 0 and 1000.

// Topics
// array
// loops
// adjacent-comparison

// Hints
// Hint 1. Remember that the array indices in JavaScript are 0-based, but the problem asks for 1-based day numbers. You can convert an index `i` to a day number by adding 1.
// Hint 2. Since the first and last elements cannot be peaks, your loop can start at index `1` and end at `rainfall.length - 2`.
// Hint 3. Use a strict inequality (`>`) to compare the current day's rainfall with both neighbors.
