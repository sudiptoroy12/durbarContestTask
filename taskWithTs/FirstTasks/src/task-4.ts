/*
Lucas is porting his old HTML website to a new ReactJS format. He needs to extract only the content within the <body> and </body> tags from various HTML files, as the rest will be automatically generated.

Your task is to write a function that takes an HTML string and returns only the content found between the opening <body> tag and the closing </body> tag. Everything else, including the tags themselves, should be ignored.

Assume the HTML is well-formed and the <body> and </body> tags will always be present. The body tags will appear on their own lines, potentially with leading whitespace for indentation, but with no other content on those lines.

Example 1
Input:
htmlString = "<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>This is my new React app.</p>
  </body>
</html>"
Output:
"
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>This is my new React app.</p>
  "
Explanation: Extracts the heading and paragraph within the body.

Example 2
Input:
htmlString = "<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <p>Hello world!</p>
    <div>
      <span>Nested content.</span>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>"
Output:
"
    <p>Hello world!</p>
    <div>
      <span>Nested content.</span>
    </div>
  "
Explanation: Extracts the paragraph and nested div content.

Constraints
The input `htmlString` will be a string.
The `<body>` and `</body>` tags will always be present in the `htmlString`.
The `<body>` and `</body>` tags will appear on their own lines, possibly with leading whitespace, but no other content.
The input string length will not exceed 10,000 characters.

function extractBodyContent(htmlString: string): string {
  const bodyStart: number = htmlString.indexOf("<body>");

  const bodyEnd: number = htmlString.indexOf("</body>");

  const bodyTagLength: number = "<body>".length;

  return htmlString.slice(bodyStart + bodyTagLength, bodyEnd);
}

console.log(
  extractBodyContent(`<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>This is my new React app.</p>
  </body>
</html>`),
);
